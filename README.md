# Scripts

Small scripts that are too big to be bash functions but too small to be 
their own repos.

### Usage

    git clone git://github.com/pbrisbin/scripts.git ~/.bin

Then, add `~/.bin` to `$PATH`.

### Notes

Any scripts that weren't written by me should have source url and author 
info (when available). Please let me know if you find something of yours 
here that's not correctly attributed.
